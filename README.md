# Using MOGONET to detect cancer/tumors
- Specifically Breast invasive carcinoma PAM50 subtype & Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients versus Normal Control (NC)


# PLEASE READ FOR GUIDE TO USING MODEL

The two main files of concern are **main_mogonet.py** and **train_test.py**
I have written a guide (a few comments) on how to navigate these 2 files and how "Integration", "Visualization" and "Databases" might work

To run the model, go to **main_mogonet.py** and press the run code button at the top right of your VS Code Screen
