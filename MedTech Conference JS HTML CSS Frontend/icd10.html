        <h2>What is ICD-10-AM?</h2>
        <p>
            ICD-10-AM is a classification system used for classifying admitted care. It is widely adopted across public and private hospitals in Australia and is updated every three years. The system is essential for coding in emergency departments, subacute care, and is used by clinical coders, healthcare providers, researchers, and public health officials.
        </p>
        <p>
            This system assigns codes to various diagnoses based on the patientâ€™s healthcare record, facilitating healthcare management and decision-making.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Key Information on ICD-10-AM Volumes</h2>
        <p>
            The ICD-10-AM system is divided into five key volumes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Volume 1:</strong> Tabular List of diseases, including a symbol to identify Australian codes.</li>
            <li><strong>Volume 2:</strong> Alphabetic Index to help coders locate diagnostic terms.</li>
            <li><strong>Volumes 3 & 4:</strong> ACHI, which classifies health interventions and surgeries.</li>
            <li><strong>Volume 5:</strong> Australian Coding Standards (ACS) for the consistent application of codes.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Applications and Usage</h2>
        <p>
            ICD-10-AM is used across Australia for managing patient care data, clinical decision-making, and public health planning. Clinical coders play a crucial role in assigning codes for diseases and health interventions, ensuring accurate data collection. This information also supports various stakeholders, including policymakers, researchers, and hospital administrators.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Education and Training</h2>
        <p>
            The latest Twelfth Edition of ICD-10-AM, implemented in July 2022, includes updates reflecting changes in healthcare practices, such as the classification of COVID-19-related diagnoses. Self-paced training modules are available to assist users in staying current with the updates and changes introduced.
